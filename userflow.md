Refined User Flow
1️⃣ Phase 1: Form Submission
This phase combines QuillForms, Whisper (STT), GPT-4, and ElevenLabs (TTS) for a conversational AI experience.

Step 1: User Starts the Screening Form
Users access the screening form on the Mindwell website.
Interaction Options:
Manual Input: Users type responses directly into the form.
Conversational AI Mode:
User Speaks: The user clicks the "Voice Input" button.
Whisper Processes Speech: User speech is transcribed to text in real time.
ElevenLabs Responds: AI-generated responses are spoken back to the user in a natural, human-like voice.
Step 2: AI Assistance During Form Completion
GPT-4 Logic:
Guides users step-by-step.
Auto-fills certain fields based on context (e.g., "next Friday at 2 PM" fills in date and time).
ElevenLabs Integration:
The system reads out questions or prompts to the user conversationally, making the process interactive and engaging.
Step 3: User Submits the Form
Once completed, the form is submitted, and data is passed to the backend for processing.
2️⃣ Phase 2: Screening & Validation
This phase incorporates GPT-4 for AI-driven screening and flags for manual review where necessary.

Step 4: AI-Powered Screening
GPT-4 Processing:
Analyzes responses for:
Red Flags: Detects critical psychiatric concerns (e.g., suicidal ideation, recent hospitalization).
Age Validation: Flags users under 18 for manual review.
Classifies users into:
Standard Case: Proceeds to automated scheduling.
Manual Review Required: Redirected to the manual scheduling calendar.
Step 5: Data Validation
Backend ensures:
Required fields are filled.
Data formats are valid (e.g., email, date of birth).
No duplicates exist in the system.
Step 6: Routing
Under 18 or Red Flags:
Redirected to a Google Calendar widget to schedule a manual review.
Standard Cases:
Proceed to automated scheduling with available time slots.
3️⃣ Phase 3: Scheduling
This phase integrates browser agents, SimplePractice, and dynamic calendar systems.

Step 7: Manual Review Scheduling
Who?
Users under 18 or flagged by AI for red flags.
What Happens?
Redirected to a Google Calendar widget embedded on the Mindwell website.
Users select a manual screening time with a clinician.
Step 8: Automated Scheduling for Standard Cases
Who?
Users 18+ with no red flags.
What Happens?
Browser agents log into SimplePractice to extract available clinician slots.
Extracted slots are displayed dynamically on the Mindwell website.
Users pick a preferred slot, which is automatically booked by the browser agent.
4️⃣ Phase 4: Notifications and Updates
Step 9: User Confirmation
Notification Channels:
Users receive confirmation via email or SMS (using Twilio or SendGrid).
Confirmation includes details about the appointment (date, time, clinician).
Step 10: Error Handling
If scheduling fails (e.g., slot conflict):
AI retries with alternative slots.
If no slots are available, the user is notified to reschedule or is escalated to manual support.

Key Points About ElevenLabs Integration
Role of ElevenLabs:
Enhances the conversational AI experience by reading back questions, confirmations, and instructions in a natural voice.
When It’s Used:
During the form-filling process (e.g., “What’s your name?” or “Your preferred appointment time is next Friday at 3 PM, correct?”).
After screening results (e.g., “We need to schedule a manual review for you. Please pick a time below.”).
Confirmation of successful scheduling (e.g., “Your appointment is confirmed for Friday at 3 PM.”).
